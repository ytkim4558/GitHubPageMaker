If you're a developer: Ghost is a completely open source (MIT) Node.js application built on a JSON API with an Ember.js admin client. It works with MySQL and SQLite, and is publicly available [on Github](https://github.com/TryGhost/ghost).

If you need help with using Ghost, you'll find a ton of useful articles on [our knowledgebase](https://help.ghost.org/), as well as extensive [developer documentation](https://docs.ghost.org/).
